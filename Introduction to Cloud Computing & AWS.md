### **What is Cloud Computing?**
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet** with a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. Instead of investing in physical data centers and servers, businesses and individuals can access computing power, storage, and databases from cloud providers.

### **Key Benefits:**
- No need to buy or maintain physical infrastructure.
- Scalable and flexible resources.
- Pay only for what you use.

### **Cloud Computing Services in the Diagram:**
1. **Networking** â€“ Managing and optimizing data transfer.
2. **Software Applications** â€“ Accessing software without installation.
3. **Security** â€“ Cloud-based encryption and security services.
4. **Data Storage** â€“ Storing and managing data remotely.
5. **Business Intelligence** â€“ Using cloud for data analytics and insights.

### **On-Premises vs Cloud Computing**

### **On-Premises (Traditional IT Infrastructure)**
- **Visible Cost**: 9% spent on **Software Licenses**.
- **Hidden Costs**:
  - **Customization & Implementation**
  - **Hardware**
  - **IT Personnel**
  - **Maintenance**
  - **Training**
- **Ongoing Costs**:
  - Fixes, patches, and upgrades.
  - Downtime and performance tuning.
  - Hardware, network, security, and database maintenance.
  - IT personnel burden.

### **Cloud Computing**
- **Visible Cost**: 68% spent on **Subscription Fee**.
- **Hidden Costs**:
  - **Implementation, Customization & Training**.
- **Ongoing Costs**:
  - Only the **subscription fee** (significantly lower operational burden).

### **Key Takeaways**
- **On-Premises** requires more upfront investment and ongoing maintenance.
- **Cloud Computing** shifts most of the responsibilities to the provider, reducing IT overhead and maintenance costs.
- The iceberg analogy shows that **cloud reduces hidden costs**, making it a cost-effective solution in the long run.
