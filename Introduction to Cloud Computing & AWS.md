- Delivers computing resources **over the internet** (servers, storage, networking, etc.).
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective, scalable, and no hardware maintenance.
- **Use Cases**: Web hosting, SaaS applications, and big data processing.

### **2️⃣ Private Cloud**
- Used exclusively by a **single organization** and can be **on-premises or hosted**.
- Provides better control over **security, compliance, and customization**.
- **Advantages**: High security, better resource allocation, and regulatory compliance.
- **Use Cases**: Government agencies, financial institutions, and enterprises with strict data policies.

### **3️⃣ Hybrid Cloud**
- A mix of **Public and Private Clouds**, allowing **data and applications to be shared**.
- Offers the **flexibility of the public cloud** with the **control of the private cloud**.
- **Advantages**: Optimized cost, scalability, and regulatory compliance.
- **Use Cases**: Businesses needing **data segregation** (e.g., storing sensitive data in a private cloud while using public cloud for scalability).

#### **Key Takeaway**
- **Public Cloud** → Best for startups, web apps, and cost-effective solutions.
- **Private Cloud** → Best for enterprises needing full control over security.
- **Hybrid Cloud** → Best for businesses needing **both flexibility & security**.
