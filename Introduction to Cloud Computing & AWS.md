### **What is Cloud Computing?**
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet** with a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. Instead of investing in physical data centers and servers, businesses and individuals can access computing power, storage, and databases from cloud providers.

### **Key Benefits:**
- No need to buy or maintain physical infrastructure.
- Scalable and flexible resources.
- Pay only for what you use.

### **Cloud Computing Services in the Diagram:**
1. **Networking** – Managing and optimizing data transfer.
2. **Software Applications** – Accessing software without installation.
3. **Security** – Cloud-based encryption and security services.
4. **Data Storage** – Storing and managing data remotely.
5. **Business Intelligence** – Using cloud for data analytics and insights.


 **On-Premises vs Cloud Computing**

### **On-Premises (Traditional IT Infrastructure)**
- **Visible Cost**: 9% spent on **Software Licenses**.
- **Hidden Costs**:
  - **Customization & Implementation**
  - **Hardware**
  - **IT Personnel**
  - **Maintenance**
  - **Training**
- **Ongoing Costs**:
  - Fixes, patches, and upgrades.
  - Downtime and performance tuning.
  - Hardware, network, security, and database maintenance.
  - IT personnel burden.

### **Cloud Computing**
- **Visible Cost**: 68% spent on **Subscription Fee**.
- **Hidden Costs**:
  - **Implementation, Customization & Training**.
- **Ongoing Costs**:
  - Only the **subscription fee** (significantly lower operational burden).

### **Key Takeaways**
- **On-Premises** requires more upfront investment and ongoing maintenance.
- **Cloud Computing** shifts most of the responsibilities to the provider, reducing IT overhead and maintenance costs.
- The iceberg analogy shows that **cloud reduces hidden costs**, making it a cost-effective solution in the long run.

 **Cloud Computing Models**:

### **1️⃣ Public Cloud**
- Owned and operated by **third-party cloud providers** (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
- Delivers computing resources **over the internet** (servers, storage, networking, etc.).
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective, scalable, and no hardware maintenance.
- **Use Cases**: Web hosting, SaaS applications, and big data processing.

### **2️⃣ Private Cloud**
- Used exclusively by a **single organization** and can be **on-premises or hosted**.
- Provides better control over **security, compliance, and customization**.
- **Advantages**: High security, better resource allocation, and regulatory compliance.
- **Use Cases**: Government agencies, financial institutions, and enterprises with strict data policies.

### **3️⃣ Hybrid Cloud**
- A mix of **Public and Private Clouds**, allowing **data and applications to be shared**.
- Offers the **flexibility of the public cloud** with the **control of the private cloud**.
- **Advantages**: Optimized cost, scalability, and regulatory compliance.
- **Use Cases**: Businesses needing **data segregation** (e.g., storing sensitive data in a private cloud while using public cloud for scalability).

#### **Key Takeaway**
- **Public Cloud** → Best for startups, web apps, and cost-effective solutions.
- **Private Cloud** → Best for enterprises needing full control over security.
- **Hybrid Cloud** → Best for businesses needing **both flexibility & security**.
